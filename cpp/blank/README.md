Basic Debian with CMake and Make installed

See CMake Tools extension
[documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/tree/main/docs#cmake-tools-for-visual-studio-code-documentation)
to create your first project with
[kits and variants](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/CMake-linux)
(seems to be discouraged,
[presets](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/blob/HEAD/docs/cmake-presets.md)
are an alternative?)

Good luck not going insane
